# QueueingApp
DJ Unicode's Queueing App

## Introduction

To simplify and assist teacher as well as student during the submissions thereby overcoming the need for physical queues (physically being present in the queue) and forming virtual ones.
- The app allows teachers to create future submission queues and also notifies the student of a particular batch about the same.
- Whenever a submission is started by a teacher, the students can then join the Queue through the app and he/she is shown his/her position the Queue. This enables the student to invest that time productively till the time is his/her turn arrives.
- Students can subscribe to a various teachers he/she wants to get notified about and then whenever the teacher updates their location or creates a submission Queue, the student will be notified about the same.

## Features
### 1. Login/Registration:
Users can register themselves up with the app via a two step verification process. Upon submitting their email ID, a security token is sent to that particular email address in order to verify the authenticity of that ID.

### 2. Creating Queues for teachers:
The teacher can select their respective subject and the batch for which they want to start the queue on the ‘Submission’ tab. The teacher can set a particular limit for the queue based on either the number of students to be taken in for submissions or by a particular time limit.

### 3. Update Queues
The teacher can change the constraints given to a certain queue via the edit queue button under the ‘Submission’ page. Upon choosing that particular option, the teacher can edit the subject, batch, number of students and the time constraint as per the need.

### 4. Queue Events	 	
All the queues created by that particular teacher are displayed on this page in the form of cards. Each card contains details about that specific queue such as the subject, batch, number of students, location, etc. Thus we get a comprehensive list of all the queues created by a particular teacher on this page.

### 5. Deleting Queues
On the ‘Recents’ page itself, wherein the entire list of queues is being displayed, the teacher can swipe left on a particular queue being displayed on the list in order to delete it.

### 6. Update Location
This is a crucial feature of the app wherein the teacher can update his/her location through the ‘Location’ page. This avoids confusion among students as to where a particular teacher might be during the submission period. Upon updating a particular teacher’s location, all the students who have subscribed to that teacher get a location update via a notification.

### 7. Joining a Queue	 
When a student wants to join a particular queue, he/she can do it through the ‘Submission’ page. On this page, we get the entire list of queues that have been created by all the teachers. Each queue has a status, the status being either a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’. If the status is ‘yes’, it means that the queue is ready to take in students and thus the particular student can join the queue. If the status is ‘no’, it means that the queue is not ready yet (the teacher has only scheduled the queue) and the students cannot join the queue.
