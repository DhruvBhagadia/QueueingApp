# QueueingApp
DJ Unicode's Queueing App

## Introduction

To simplify and assist teacher as well as student during the submissions thereby overcoming the need for physical queues (physically being present in the queue) and forming virtual ones.
- The app allows teachers to create future submission queues and also notifies the student of a particular batch about the same.
- Whenever a submission is started by a teacher, the students can then join the Queue through the app and he/she is shown his/her position the Queue. This enables the student to invest that time productively till the time is his/her turn arrives.
- Students can subscribe to a various teachers he/she wants to get notified about and then whenever the teacher updates their location or creates a submission Queue, the student will be notified about the same.

The teacher can select their respective subject and the batch for which they want to start the queue on the ‘Submission’ tab. The teacher can set a particular limit for the queue based on either the number of students to be taken in for submissions or by a particular time limit.
